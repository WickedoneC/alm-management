    "## 5. Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Duration Tells a Portfolio Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "Duration is effectively the **interest rate beta** of a bond. A portfolio with a modified duration of 8 will lose approximately 8% of its market value for every 100 basis point rise in rates. For an institution managing billions in fixed income assets, this translates directly into P&L impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A \\$1 billion portfolio with modified duration of 8 stands to lose **\\$80 million** for a 100 bp rate increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations from This Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Duration increases with maturity, but not linearly.** The 30Y Treasury has roughly 15x the maturity of the 2Y but only about 9x the modified duration. This concavity is driven by discounting — distant cash flows contribute less to price sensitivity because they are worth less today.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convexity accelerates with maturity.** The 30Y bond's convexity dwarfs the short-end bonds. This is the \"convexity advantage\" — long bonds benefit disproportionately from rate rallies, which is why asset managers often prefer the long end when they expect rates to fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Corporate vs. Treasury at the same maturity.** The 5Y Corporate has a *lower* modified duration than the 5Y Treasury despite having a higher yield. This is because the higher coupon (5.50% vs. 4.00%) returns more cash earlier, pulling the \"center of gravity\" of cash flows forward. For ALM purposes, this means corporate bonds provide *less* interest rate exposure per dollar invested.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DV01 scales with duration and price.** DV01 is the metric most directly tied to hedging — it tells you the dollar amount at risk per basis point. Matching DV01 across assets and liabilities is the first step in any immunization strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for ALM\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Duration matching**: Set portfolio duration equal to the duration of liabilities to immunize against parallel yield curve shifts.\n",
    "- **Convexity management**: Positive convexity in assets vs. liabilities creates a natural hedge against large rate moves.\n",
    "- **Key rate analysis**: Parallel shifts are an approximation. Real yield curve moves are non-parallel, which is why key rate durations (covered in a future notebook) are essential for precision hedging."
