# Development Session - February 6, 2026

## Session Overview
- **Started:** Phase 1 & 2 validation and notebook creation
- **Goal:** Create analysis notebooks with synthetic data
- **Status:** ✅ Notebook 1 complete and running successfully

## Key Decisions Made

### Notebook Strategy
- **Decision:** Create 3 notebooks sequentially
  1. ✅ Duration analysis with synthetic bonds (COMPLETE)
  2. ⏳ Yield curve scenarios with FRED data (NEXT SESSION)
  3. ⏳ Integrated portfolio analysis (FUTURE)
- **Rationale:** Build complexity gradually, validate each step

### Data Sources
- **Phase 1 (Complete):** Synthetic bond portfolio
  - 5 bonds: 2Y, 5Y, 10Y, 30Y Treasury + 5Y Corporate
  - Realistic 2024-2026 yields
  - Full control for demonstration
- **Phase 2 (Next Session):** FRED Treasury data
  - No API key needed initially
  - Real market data integration

### Technical Setup
- ✅ Installed: JupyterLab, ipykernel, matplotlib, seaborn
- ✅ Installed: pandas-datareader, yfinance (for FRED)
- ✅ Enabled: Pylance type checking in VS Code
- ✅ Using: VS Code native Jupyter (not browser)
- ✅ Kernel: alm-management environment working

## Work Completed This Session

### Infrastructure & Documentation
- ✅ Updated .gitignore with comprehensive Python exclusions
- ✅ Created professional README.md (cleaned, employer-focused)
- ✅ Updated PROJECT_LOG.md with Phase 2 completion
- ✅ Created context management system (SESSION files)
- ✅ Initialized Git repository
- ✅ Created GitHub repository (public): https://github.com/WickedoneC/alm-management.git
- ✅ Pushed initial commit to GitHub

### Notebook 1: Duration Analysis Demo ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Created `notebooks/01_duration_analysis_demo.ipynb`
- ✅ Structure: 6 code cells with markdown explanations
- ✅ Synthetic bond portfolio (5 bonds with realistic yields)
- ✅ All duration metrics calculated correctly:
  - 2Y Treasury: Modified Duration = 1.89
  - 5Y Treasury: Modified Duration = 4.49
  - 10Y Treasury: Modified Duration = 8.06
  - 30Y Treasury: Modified Duration = 16.02
  - 5Y Corporate: Modified Duration = 4.32
- ✅ Key financial insight validated: 5Y Corporate < 5Y Treasury duration (higher coupon pulls cash flows forward)
- ✅ Visualizations: 4 professional charts (bar, scatter, line, table)
- ✅ Notebook runs successfully in VS Code with "Run All"
- ✅ Professional markdown from buy-side perspective

### Technical Issues Resolved
- ✅ Jupyter kernel "DISPOSED" error - fixed by restarting VS Code
- ✅ Pylance type checking enabled (better code quality)
- ✅ VS Code Jupyter extension configured properly
- ✅ ipykernel registered for alm-management environment

## Current Status

### What Works
- ✅ Duration calculator (39 tests passing)
- ✅ Yield curve framework (102 tests passing)
- ✅ Total: 165 unit tests passing
- ✅ Notebook 1 executes cleanly with correct outputs
- ✅ All visualizations rendering properly
- ✅ GitHub repository up and running

### What's Next (Next Session)
- ⏳ Review Notebook 1 outputs in detail
- ⏳ Create Notebook 2: Yield curve with FRED data
- ⏳ Add forward rate analysis
- ⏳ Scenario visualizations (parallel, steepen, flatten)
- ⏳ Commit notebooks with outputs to GitHub

## Important Context for Next Session

### Environment Reactivation
```bash
cd ~/projects/alm-management
micromamba activate alm-management
```

### Key Files Created This Session
- `notebooks/01_duration_analysis_demo.ipynb` - Duration analysis (COMPLETE)
- `docs/context/SESSION_2026-02-06.md` - This file
- Updated: `README.md`, `PROJECT_LOG.md`, `.gitignore`
- Updated: `requirements.txt` (added jupyter, jupyterlab, ipykernel, viz libraries)

### Dependencies Installed
**Core (already had):**
- numpy, scipy, pandas, pytest

**Added this session:**
- jupyter, jupyterlab, ipykernel
- matplotlib, seaborn
- pandas-datareader, yfinance

### GitHub Repository
- **URL:** https://github.com/WickedoneC/alm-management.git
- **Visibility:** Public (for employer portfolio)
- **Last commit:** Initial ALM system with Phases 1 & 2

## Your Workflow Preferences

### Session Management
- ✅ Remind at session start: reactivate environment, read context
- ✅ Remind at session end: update docs, commit, push to Git
- ✅ Session start triggers: "let's reactivate", "let's continue", long timestamp gaps
- ✅ Session end triggers: "let's push to git", "let's commit", "that's all for today"

### Development Workflow
- ✅ Claude Code (VS Code) for implementation
- ✅ Claude.ai (web) for strategy, validation, financial review
- ✅ Terminal for quick commands
- ✅ JupyterLab in VS Code (not browser-based)
- ✅ Clear action items at end of conversations
- ✅ Explicit reminders for environment activation

### Portfolio Strategy
- ✅ Public GitHub repos for educational/portfolio projects (like ALM)
- ✅ Private repos for actual trading strategies
- ✅ Professional documentation for employer visibility

### Career Goals
- **Target:** Buy-side roles managing bond portfolios
- **Interest:** MS Financial Engineering (Columbia, CMU, Berkeley, NYU)
- **Focus:** Python + quantitative finance + LLMs/AI applications

### Future Projects (Separate Repos)
- Options pricing system
- Mean-reversion strategies  
- 1-week to 1-month trading strategies
- Will keep trading strategies private

## Technical Learnings This Session
- `.gitkeep` makes Git track empty directories
- `micromamba activate` sets environment (shows in parentheses)
- `cd` and `activate` are independent operations
- VS Code native Jupyter > browser for integrated workflow
- Jupyter "DISPOSED" errors fixed by restarting VS Code
- Pylance type checking improves code quality
- Claude Skills available: docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf, frontend-design

## Financial Validation This Session
- ✅ Duration formulas implemented correctly
- ✅ 5Y Corporate < 5Y Treasury duration is correct (coupon effect)
- ✅ Convexity values positive and reasonable for vanilla bonds
- ✅ DV01 calculations scale properly with duration and price
- ✅ All metrics pass "smell test" for institutional use
